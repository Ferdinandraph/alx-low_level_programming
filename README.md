Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming
In this repository i will be working on all c low level programming projects through alx - Software engineering program in collision with holberton School and self created project
-	0x00. C - Hello, World
-	0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
-	0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
-	0x03. C – debugging
-	0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
-	0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
-	0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
-	0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
-	0x08. C – Recursion
-	0x09. C - Static libraries
-	0x0A. C - argc, argv
-	0x0B. C - malloc, free
-	0x0C. C - More malloc, free
-	0x0D. C – Preprocessor
-	0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
-	0x0F. C - Function pointers
-	0x10. C - Variadic functions
-	0x11. C – printf
-	0x12. C - Singly linked lists
-	0x14-bit_manipulation
-	0x15-file_io
- simple_shell

Doing hard things is what i do to become a successful software engineer !!
